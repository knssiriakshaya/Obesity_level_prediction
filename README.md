# **Predicting Obesity Levels Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods**  
*Infosys Springboard 5.0 Project*  

---

## **Project Description**  
This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The goal is to classify obesity levels such as insufficient weight, normal weight, overweight, and various types of obesity.

### **Key Features**  
- **Dataset Utilization**: Uses the Kaggle dataset “Obesity based on eating habits and physical conditions” created by Lesumit Kumar Roy, with 17 attributes.  
- **Model Building**: Implements ML and DL models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, and ANN.  
- **Visualization**: Generates charts and graphs to illustrate obesity distribution, physical activity, and lifestyle factors.  
- **Web Application**: A user-friendly interface allows users to input data and predict obesity levels.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.  
- **Deep Learning**: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS.  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask).  
- **Tools**: Kaggle datasets, StandardScaler, and data encoding techniques.
